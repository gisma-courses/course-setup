## A note on assignments in education
Please remember that also this course uses assignments. Hence, our very strong suggestion is the following: First, try to solve each task at hand individually. Second, invite and involve colleagues and share your individual solutions. Help each other, leaf no one behind, discuss problems, pros and cons and rethink your solution which will be the one which is submitted and/or forms the basis for the next task in your problem solving workflow. In doing so you will get the maximum from this course because learning and training your skills is most effective in problem-based and peer-to-peer scenarios.


Please do not take any shortcuts here, just do it right and take as much from this course as you can.
